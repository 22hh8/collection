The Tate Collection
===================

Contains:

1. Folders of JSON files representing artists, artworks and archive data in the Tate Collection.
2. CSV lists of the unique IDs of the artists and artworks at Tate

The CSV lists are encoded in the Windows CP1252 codepage. I would convert them to UTF-8 but that would make it too easy.

Once we've cleared copyright on this stuff we hope to CC0 the metadata and whack open this repo to everyone.
