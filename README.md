The Tate Collection
===================

Images are not included and are not part of the dataset. Use of Tate images is covered on the
[Copyright and permissions](http://www.tate.org.uk/about/who-we-are/policies-and-procedures/website-terms-use/copyright-and-permissions) page. You may also [license images](http://tate-images.com) for commercial use.

Contains:

1. Folders of JSON files representing artists, artworks and archive data in the Tate Collection.
2. CSV lists of the unique IDs of the artists and artworks at Tate

The CSV lists are encoded in the Windows CP1252 codepage. I would convert them to UTF-8 but that would make it too easy.
